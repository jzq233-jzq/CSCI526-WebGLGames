Instructions
For this first homework assignment, we’re giving you a choice. If you’re new to Unity and game development, we recommend following the Unity Beginner Sequence, which runs through the basics of Unity and games programming.

If you’re familiar with the material and instead prefer something more challenging, you can follow the Unity Advanced Sequence, where you can learn about Unity’s more advanced features, such as cameras, UI, and animation.

You can’t complete both sequences for additional extra credit. If you complete both sequences, and receive full credit for everything, you’ll receive no more than 100 points. We don’t necessarily recommend doing this, as it may take awhile, but if you’re really driven to learn Unity and get a jump on more advanced game programming, go for it!

We expect you to complete one of these sequences in its entirety. If you do half of the beginner sequence and half of the advanced sequence, you’ll get, at most, 50% credit. Hence we highly recommend you complete the beginner sequence before starting the advanced sequence if you are new to Unity. If you’re new to Unity programming but curious about the advanced sequence, wait until you finish the entire beginner sequence before starting advanced, if you desire to do both.

To show your work on the tutorials, you’ll submit a screenshot or series of screenshots showing the completed “missions” you’ve done in green. These screenshots should have your unique username visible. An example of such a screenshot can be seen here: Section 1 - Individual Work Tutorial Submission Example.png.

Each of your playable deliverables should be hosted on either GitHub Pages or Unity Play, and publicly accessible via a url. You’ll submit them in the form of a text document filled with the urls.

If you’ve chosen the Unity Beginner Sequence, we also expect you to submit the design document that you created as part of the JPP.

The assignment is to be submitted via the Brightspace submission link by July 8th, 2025, 11:59pm. Late submissions will be penalized by 10% per day according to the syllabus policy.
